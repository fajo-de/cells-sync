Cells Sync is a desktop synchronization client for Pydio Cells server.  

## Features

- 100% GO
- Windows, MacOSX, Linux
- Realtime propagation of changes _(when your local machine can connect to your server)_
- Configurable sync direction (bi-directional / unidirectional)
- Selective Folders synchronization
- Supports various types of end points for syncing (any source/target can be combined):
  - Cells Server (over HTTP/HTTPS)
  - Local Folder
  - Local Cells server (accessed directly if deployed inside the microservices mesh)
  - S3-compatible storage service (tested with AWS S3)
  - BoltDB storage (used for storing tree snapshots)
  - Cells gRPC indexation services (implementing NodeProvider/NodeReceiver gRPC endpoints).

## Getting Started

If you are using a Mac or Windows personal computer, you might directly download a pre-packaged installer for your OS from our [Download Server](https://download.pydio.com/latest/cells-sync/release/{latest}/). Furthermore, you should read this [page of our documentation](https://pydio.com/en/docs/cells/v2/connect-desktop-sync) to get a functionnal overview of the tool.

We also provide pre-compiled binaries for [Linux](https://download.pydio.com/latest/cells-sync/release/{latest}/linux-amd64/cells-sync), [MacOS](https://download.pydio.com/latest/cells-sync/release/{latest}/darwin-amd64/cells-sync) and [Windows](https://download.pydio.com/latest/cells-sync/release/{latest}/windows-amd64/cells-sync.exe): simply download the tool and launch it.  
See [the instructions below](#running-cells-sync) for further details.

Note that synchronization must be configured and enabled **on the server side**: if you are running in a non-vanilla environment (e.g. behind a reverse proxy), we have gathered [some tips in our knowledge base](https://pydio.com/en/docs/kb/client-applications/setup-cells-server-cellssync) that should help you fix usual networking issues.

## Compiling from sources

The below instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for **development** and testing purposes. To simply deploy a running binary, see the [previous section](#getting-started).

### Pre-requisites

In order to compile and run the Cells-Sync client, you must fulfill the following requirements:

- GOLANG developement toolchain properly installed (tested with 1.12 and higher)
- NodeJS/NPM environment in order to compile the frontend, you need an up-to-date version of NPM (tested with node version 12.X)

### Compilation instructions

- Get the code: `go get github.com/pydio/cells-sync/...`
- Change directory to `app/ux/`
- To load frontend dependencies run `npm install`
- To compile the frontend, run `npm run build`
- To pack the frontend inside the binary (not mandatory if you are running on the same machine where $GOPATH is available), install github.com/gobuffalo/packr/packr tool and run `make clean pack` at the root of the repository.

[ Update 04/16/2020 ]  
Due to a dependency issue, until we switch to modules or until this dependency master is stable again, you have to apply the following before calling the make command:

```sh
cd github.com/zserge/webview
git checkout 9c1b0a888aa40039d501c1ea9f60b22a076a25ea
```

[ to be continued ]

- Compile binary by running `make cli`

The resulting `cells-sync` binary should be good to go.

## Running cells-sync

Once you have downloaded or compiled cells-sync for your platform, simply run:

```sh
./cells-sync start
```

This both starts the system tray icon and the synchronization agent in background. To run the agent without any UX, use `cells-sync start --headless`.

### Other available commands

Use help to display the available commands:

```sh
$ ./cells-sync --help
Usage:
  ./cells-sync [flags]
  ./cells-sync [command]

Available Commands:
  add         Add a new task via command line
  autotest    Basic unidirectional sync between two local folders (under your temporary directory)
  bgstart     Start sync tasks from within service
  capture     Capture snapshots inside JSON file - do not perform any actual tasks
  delete      Delete existing sync via command line
  edit        Exit existing sync via command line
  help        Help about any command
  service     Manage service: install,uninstall,stop,start,restart
  start       Start sync tasks
  systray     Launch Systray
  version     Display version
  webview     Launch WebView

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for ./cells-sync

Use "./cells-sync [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```


## Troubleshooting

If you are running Cells Sync in a docker container make sure to also use the interactive shell flag `-i` with the run command [see docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#assign-name-and-allocate-pseudo-tty---name--it).
